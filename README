This week was my first experience with python, data scraping, utilizing html for displaying data, and csv manipulation.

To run this project, run BasicBokeh.py.

BasicScrape.py is designed to pull dates, humidity, highs temperatures, and low temperatures
            from weather.com's 10 day forecast.

It does this utilizing BeautifulSoup to pull all tags with class attributes for the corresponding data
            points and stores them in a list.

Once it has stored the significant data from the html into the lists, it prints the data to a csv file and exits.

BasicBokeh.py is designed to open the csv file, saved by BasicScrape.py, store the data into lists, and
            then display the data in a graph, utilizing Bokeh.

Before running the code written for BasicBokeh.py, the file calls BasicScrape.py to ensure that
    1) the csv file exists
    2) the data is up-to-date

Before exiting, the program opens the computer's default html-viewing application and displays the graph,
            showing humidity, high temperatures, and low temperatures in green, red, and blue respectively.
